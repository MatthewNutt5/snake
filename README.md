# snake
Final project for ELEC 422 - Basic Snake game implemented in CMOS static logic

## Setup

### Directories/Symlinks

The `/snake/source` directory holds the actual "hard" files of the repo, whereas the other directories hold "soft" symbolic links (symlinks) pointing to the source directory. This way, files can be automatically synchronized across multiple directories. For example, Verilog files are used by Questa for simulation, so the `/snake/source/verilog` directory holds the hard `.v` files while the `/snake/Questa` contains symlinks pointing to those hard files.

Any important file generated by the design tools (e.g. the .vh files from Design Compiler, .gds from Innovus, etc.) should be left as hard files in their directory of origin, then linked where needed. For example, `/snake/Innovus` holds the hard file `final.gds`, and `/snake/Irsim` has a symlink to it.

### `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` is set up as a whitelist - a file/file type must be added for Git to track it. The `.gitignore` should be set to only keep track of the hard files in `/snake/source`, hard files generated by the design tools, and the symlinks to them; other files like logs, reports, etc. should not be included in the repo. Note that Git treats symlinks according to the type of file they point to - whitelisting Verilog files will include both the hard files and symlinks to them. Also, the `.gitignore` is configured such that files without a suffix, i.e. the scripts that run Design Compiler and Innovus, should be in the format `run_*`, in order for Git to track them.
